         <h1>Moth Man Sighting</h1>
         <h2>April 2024: Kane County, Illinois</h2>
            <p>
               The most recent <i>Mothman</i> sighting happened in Kane County, Illinois, in April 2024. 
               Matt Sexton, 33, was driving to work on a secluded stretch of road late at night when he suddenly noticed a large “bird” following his vehicle.
               Interestingly, this wasn’t his first time seeing the creature. He had two similar experiences in 2023. “I’ve had three different encounters that started around the same time last year in April or May,” 
               he recalled in an interview with the Singular Fortean Society. Both previous encounters happened early in the morning, between 1:30 and 3:30 a.m. 
               The first sighting occurred along US Highway 30, near Hinckley, Illinois. “I was driving my truck since I’m a semi-driver and tend to do late-night runs,” Sexton explained. 
               “I saw this huge branch fall from a tree and hit the road ahead of me, so I looked up and saw what must have been a 12-foot creature. It was covered in short brown fur—not leathery like you’d expect.”
               He described the creature as “humanoid,” noting that it had distinct legs and arms separate from its wings. 
               “It flew right in front of my truck, kind of like when an eagle dives and then opens its wings at the last second to fly off,” he said.
               Initially, Sexton brushed off the sighting, thinking it might have been a large bird. “It freaked me out, but I figured there had to be some logical explanation,” he said. 
               “So, I just dismissed it.” But about three weeks later, on I-39, just 10 miles from his first sighting, he saw the same creature <em>again</em>.<br>
